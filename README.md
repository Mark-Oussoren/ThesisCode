# Distributional Reinforcement Learning - Optimal Execution (Weston 2020)

## File Descriptions 
**Run_me.py** - This file includes global params for traning the model. I'll summarize the customizatios possible soon. The output of the file is sent to Wandb - a model tracker much like MLFlow. To set up, pip install wandb and link to your account. I'll add a graph of what the output should be like here - it tracks actions, states, rewards, etc.

**market_modelsM.py** - This includes the price evolution.
